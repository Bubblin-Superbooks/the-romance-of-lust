### TABLET FIRST &amp; OFFLINE FIRST

Superbooks are naturally responsive and work on all browsers, all viewports and devices and all operating systems. See support information [here](https://bubblin.io/support) and the full list of supported devices [here](https://bubblin.io/devices). In general, the most ideal surface to read these books on (recommended) are the \~9&quot; tablets like the iPad or the Galaxy Tab or Kindle Fire HD, ala 'on-web'.

This book is _offline-first_. Is uses a Service Worker under the hood, so no explicit download is required to read or share the book OFFLINE.

## HACKING, FIXES AND TRANSLATIONS


#### A. HACKING THE BOOK

For example, if you want to mint your own edition of say `Pride &amp; Prejudice` (like typesetting it anew or adding new art or illustrations to it), follow the below given steps:

1. Fork this repository to your own Github Account,
2. Clone the forked project to your local,
3. Install [Bookiza](https://bookiza.io) globally. This requires node and npm,
4. `cd` into the repo and `$ npm install` to install the dependencies
