### TABLET FIRST &amp; OFFLINE FIRST

Superbooks are naturally responsive and are generally [supported](https://bubblin.io/support) across all browsers and devices. However, the most ideal surface to read these books on (recommended) are the \~9&quot; tablets like the iPad or the Galaxy Tab.

We try and suppport all devices and desktops&#x2014;meaning, all modern browsers, all viewports and all operating systems starting from an Apple Watch to an LCD TV. See our full list of supported devices [here](https://bubblin.io/devices).

The live book is _offline-first_ using a Service Worker, so no explicit download is required to read or share the book OFFLINE.

### MANUSCRIPT (this repo)

The manuscript on this repo has been generated programmatically using [Bookiza Abelone](https://bookiza.io), [h2s](https://github.com/bookiza/h2s) and a few other markup sanitization libraries.


:point_right: Note, this git repository is the `manuscript` while the book is _live_ and served hot on the url provided on top. This difference in the &apos;state of work&apos; is part of the vocabulary when publishing with Bookiza.


### FULLSCREEN MODE:

To be able to read the book in [fullscreen mode](https://bubblin.io/blog/fullscreen-api-ipad), please try these steps:

- Open the book on iOS (&gt; 12.00) Safari
- Tap the `...` button at bottom right of the screen to open Superbook controls.
- Tap `&#x292E;` on the top right (middle button) to go fullscreen.

iPadOS Safari v12.0 and above only.

## HACKING, FIXES AND TRANSLATIONS


#### A. HACKING THE BOOK

For example, if you want to mint your own edition of say `Pride &amp; Prejudice` (like typesetting it anew or adding new art or illustrations to it), follow the below given steps:

1. Fork this repository to your own Github Account,
2. Clone the forked project to your local,
3. Install [Bookiza](https://bookiza.io) globally. This requires node and npm,
4. `cd` into the repo and `$ npm install` to install the dependencies
5. Start the server with `$ bookiza server`

Bookiza will build the manuscript on project and serve it like a book over `localhost:4567`. Open the project on your favorite text editor (Visual Studio, Sublime) and hack away, and feel free to republish your own new edition!

If you end up creating a new avatar of this book, please leave us a note here. We love looking at interesting new takes from people across the world and will also be super happy to help you publish it online.


#### B. SUBMITTING FIXES

PRs are absolutely welcome!

Issues pertaining to only this book may be raised on this Github repository.


#### C. TRANSLATIONS

Translation to other languages or new takes of English itself from the original (old) script may earn you a copyright. If you fork a new edition with a translation of your own, we might consider your work for a premium publication.
