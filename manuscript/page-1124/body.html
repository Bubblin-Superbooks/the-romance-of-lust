And do you believe there will be another woman in the whole world beside yourself for whom I shall have any desire?

Tell me, do you believe this? You know it perfectly well, I am sure; these are not mere words. Tell me that you will piss into my mouth again when I ask you. I am now going to try to sleep, but what chance of doing so with this love that consumes me. I must await your pretty letter of tomorrow morning, for it is that alone which will excite the flow and stream.</p></div> </div>
