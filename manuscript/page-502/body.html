So perforce they shook me up. I acted the suddenly awakened sleeper very well. As soon as we were out of the coach, I whispered to the doctor—</p><p>“If you please, uncle, I want to piddle very bad.”</p><p>“Come here, my dear boy.”</p><p>And taking me behind some wagons in the innyard, where we would not be seen, he said—</p><p>“Here, we can both piss down this grating.”</p><p>And, forsooth, to encourage me, pulled out his own standing pego. I saw what he wanted, and out with my own in all its length and strength.</p></div> </div>
