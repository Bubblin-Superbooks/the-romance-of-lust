<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h3>Cavendish And Rochefoucault.</h3><p>Rome, <em>Saturday</em></p><p><em>August 6th, 1859, 10 o’clock</em>.</p><p>I tried last night, my angel, to write you a half sheet, but it was as much as I could do to read your letter a second time, and it was only by making a great effort that I was able to write a few lines. However, this morning I will try and continue, in order to reward you, not for that one which you have deprived me of from pique, but for those bewitching ones which I have lately received.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line">I have just received your letter 17, begun August 3rd, 11 o’clock at night, and bless you for the idea of addressing it to Pal. B., it is infinitely preferable, and there is no fear of any risk (“indiscretion” in original)</p></div> </div>
